<p>
  Friendly, customizable and accessible-ready simple photo gallery based on React.
</p>


------

**IMPORTANT NOTICE**: This repository is forked from [https://github.com/peterpalau/react-bnb-gallery](https://github.com/peterpalau/react-bnb-gallery) and added custom component for photo options which is required for my personal use case. 
**This repo is meant for those who needs custom components for images like me.**
Thus, I recommend using original library: `react-bnb-gallery` for other use cases. I will pull from original repo from time to time but I won't guarantee this one would be up-to-date all time. Finally, I will stop maintaining this repo when original implements custom component feature.

## Install

You can install [react-bnb-gallery](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@zawlinnnaing/react-bnb-gallery) from [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/).
